![Quantum Swap Dashboard Screenshot](public/screenshots/post.png)

**Quantum Swap** is an innovative decentralized platform that combines the powerful features of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the privacy and convenience of Web3. All platform functionality is available without KYC — just connect your TON wallet (Tonkeeper, OpenMask, and others).

## 🚀 Project Status & Development Story

Quantum Swap is currently in active development. Both frontend and backend components are being continuously improved, tested, and expanded to bring the community the most robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich DEX experience in the TON ecosystem.

- **Frontend:**  
  We are focused on delivering a modern, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface with seamless integration into TON wallets and the Telegram Mini App ecosystem.  
  Our team is actively adding new features, enhancing security, and polishing the user experience.

- **Backend & Smart Contracts:**  
  The backend and all smart contract logic are under intensive development and internal security audit.  
  We are building secure integrations with the TON blockchain, scalable APIs, and unique smart contract mechanisms such as PoSO Mining, advanced liquidity management, and cross-functional staking pools.

**Please note:**  
This repository contains only a **demo version** of the frontend. All features in this demo are implemented using mock data and placeholders.  
No real backend integrations, live blockchain operations, or business-critical algorithms are included in this public version for security and intellectual property protection.
