# Components â€” Demo Version

This folder contains a limited selection of React components required for the public demo version of the Quantum Swap DEX frontend.

**Please note:**
- Not all components used in the full product are included in this repository.
- Many advanced, unique, or business-critical components have been intentionally omitted or replaced with simplified versions for security and intellectual property reasons.
- Only essential and safe-to-share components are present here, primarily for user interface demonstration.

If you represent a serious company, investor, or grant provider and wish to see the complete set of components and advanced implementations, please contact us with an official request.  
Access to the full component library may be granted after review and under NDA.
