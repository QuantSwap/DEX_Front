# Hooks â€” Demo Version

This directory contains only a minimal set of custom React hooks required for this public demo version of the Quantum Swap DEX frontend.

**Note:**
- In the full production version, we utilize a wide range of proprietary and advanced hooks tailored for our exchange platform and its unique features.
- For demo purposes and intellectual property protection, most hooks have been removed from this repository, especially those unrelated to UI or that could be used outside our DEX context.
- The hooks presented here are either basic, project-specific, or required for UI demonstration only.

If you represent a serious company, investor, or grant provider and wish to review the full set of custom hooks and advanced logic, please contact us officially.  
Access may be granted under review and NDA.
